# Agricultural-Effects-of-Unconventional-Oil-Gas-Development
Codes as part of a research project that I participated in while a PhD student. My work is now in the hands of my previous supervisor as I have left the program. I have attached a rough draft of the working paper above. The manuscript attached was from before the event study methodology was included. 

Order of Code: 
1) create_well_production_data_f
2) randomForest_well_classification_f
3) randomForest_year_regression_f
4) interpolate_spud_year_f
5) calculate_county_wells_f
6) convert_narr_data_f 
7) match_wind_to_well_f
8) map_upwind_downwind_wells_f
9) map_covariate_data_f
10) subset_buffer_data_discrete_f
11) subset_buffer_data_discrete_vertical_f
12) spud_year_loop_f (Performs baseline model running loop at various buffer distances to gauge total effect using SPUD year)
13) baseline_robustness_f
14) baseline_withCOGD_robustness_f
15) bootstrap_t
16) calculate_crop_less_t
17) event_study_f
